Title: React UI Assignment â€” InputField & DataTable (React + TypeScript + Tailwind, Storybook, Vitest)

Overview:
- Built two reusable, accessible UI components with modern stack (React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + TailwindCSS).
- Documented in Storybook (states: default/invalid/loading/password/clearable for InputField; default/loading/selectable/empty for DataTable).
- Added Vitest + Testing Library unit tests covering core interactions.
- Included a demo page showcasing integration of both components.

How to run locally:
1) npm install
2) npm run dev         # demo
3) npm run storybook   # component docs
4) npm test            # unit tests
5) npm run build       # production build (Vite)

Highlights:
- Accessibility: labelled inputs, aria-invalid, aria-sort, keyboard-friendly controls.
- Type safety: generic DataTable<T>, strict TS config, forwardRef InputField.
- DX & QA: Storybook for design review, tests for reliability, clean README for onboarding.

Notes:
- Happy to walk through code decisions (sorting strategy, selection state, a11y) and extend features (pagination, form library integration).
